**Notes:** 
When registering an account, Email must contain an @ symbol and . with 2 characters, with text in between both symbols. Passwords must contain at least 6 characters.

When registering an account, fake emails can be used (emails are not authenticated).

Google sign works on real devices well but has some issues on some emulators, especially when you re-sign in after logging out.

The app is set to min API/SDK version 21.

Firebase is used as an external database which stores user information and users task/events, which are linked to the users credentials.

Streak systems & plus status are stored on the android device rather than in the firebase realtime database.
