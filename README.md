# Just-To-Do-It

Write what you are currently working on here:

Ben: Working out which database to use and how to add stuff to the database

Ben: Added Drawable box and line files which can be used in the UI. Use them by adding a text view and setting the background
src to drawable/'the item you want'.

Michael: Google Authentication





Useful information:

Sometimes I have to run the app twice to sync code changes made (in case anyone else experiences this)

Most/all users passwords are: qwerty

When a user is created, currently the user is added to the realtime database with their uid as pk, along with their email and a random string(for now)
